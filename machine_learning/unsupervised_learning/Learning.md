Unsupervised learning details with unlabelled or unstructured data, deals with pattern recognition.

## X-tics
No labelled data is provided
The model identifies hidden patterns, structures or relation in data
Used for EDA exploratory data analysis
Handles large volumes of data

## Techniques
Clustering 
Dimensionality Reduction
Anomally Detection
Association Rule Learning

# Algorithms for clustering
K-Means Clustering
Hierarchical clustering
Density Based Spartial Clustering

Advantages of unsupervised learning
Useful for discovering unknown patterns
No need for labelled data
Can handle large complex data
flexible for EDA

Example one: Real Problems
Create a dataset to cluster customers based on their annual income and spending
K-means clustering
